# Provider Sign-up and Dashboard System Implementation

## What's Been Added

### 1. Provider Sign-up Process
- **Multi-step application form** (`/provider-signup`)
  - Step 1: Basic Information (name, email, phone, business description)
  - Step 2: Services & Response Time (service categories, response time preferences)
  - Step 3: Location (Kenya counties/cities, service radius)
  - Step 4: Pricing (KSH hourly rates, pricing notes)

### 2. Kenya-Specific Features
- **Location System**: Kenya counties and cities for service areas
- **Distance Display**: Shows distance in kilometers (e.g., "6.4km away â€¢ Nairobi City")
- **Currency**: Uses Kenyan Shillings (KSH) for pricing (e.g., "KSH 1,500-3,000/hr")
- **Response Time**: Provider-specified response times (same day, within 2 days, within a week)

### 3. Provider Dashboard (`/provider-dashboard`)
- Stats overview (new requests, active chats, rating, completed jobs)
- Service request management (accept/decline requests)
- Active conversations with clients
- Profile management
- Real-time notifications

### 4. Client Dashboard (`/client-dashboard`)
